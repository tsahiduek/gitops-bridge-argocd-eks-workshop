# Multi-Cluster centralized hub-spoke topology

This example deploys ArgoCD on the Hub cluster (ie. management/control-plane cluster).
The spoke clusters are registered as remote clusters in the Hub Cluster's ArgoCD
The ArgoCD on the Hub Cluster deploy addons and workloads to the spoke clusters

Each spoke cluster gets deployed an app of apps ArgoCD Application with the name `workloads-${env}`

Deploy the Hub Cluster
```shell
cd hub
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Access Terraform output for Hub Cluster
```shell
cd hub
terraform output
```


Deploy the Spoke Clusters
```shell
cd spokes
./deploy.sh staging
./deploy.sh prod
```
Each environment uses a Terraform workspace

Access Terraform output for each environment
```shell
cd spokes
terraform workspace select ${env}
terraform output
```

Destroy Spoke Clusters
```shell
cd spokes
./destroy.sh staging
./destroy.sh prod
```

Destroy Hub Clusters
```shell
cd hub
./destroy.sh
```
